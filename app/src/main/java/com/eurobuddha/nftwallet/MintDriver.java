 *
 * Mirrors the family's shared-brain convention (Limit's {@code LimitProcessor}, AtomiX's
 * {@code SwapEngine}) so foreground and background behave identically.
 *
 * Every call returns a {@link Result}. That is the point: the old entry point returned silently
 * when a tick was already running or when it decided nothing was active — and its idea of "active"
 * excluded NEEDIMAGES, while the Resume button was shown for every phase but DONE. Tapping Resume
 * on a paused collection therefore did nothing at all, with no explanation. A caller can no longer
